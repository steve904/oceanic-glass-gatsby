It's not heavy rain today...more of a mist. The heavy rain was making it's dance last night. This morning is very cloudy and everything seems quieter than usual for a Saturday morning at 9:00.

## Dogs Have Been Out

I have taken all three dogs out for their morning pee and poop. Big boy Amos has still got his cone of shame on and does very well with it. He had surgery a little over a day ago. He is doing well considering that he had his stomach tacked and his manhood (testicles) removed.
